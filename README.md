# My First Landing Page
This Project I am going to make a Landing Page of a Coffee Shop. It's finally time to put some designs into our bland HTML site. The Format of the Design for the website is already given by TOP, but the rest is up to the Developer. 

What I've learnt before the Project:

- Concepts of Flex and Alignment
- Basic CSS Functions.
- Padding, Margin, and Border

Reflections:

1. This is my first time making a HTML/CSS without looking at other people's code. I'm proud of myself really. Used a few notes, google searches and documentations. But not at all did I look at other people's code. 

2. The Responsiveness of the Website is a total disaster. Was able to rescued some from being squashed. 

3. I felt like there was always gap between my CSS knowledge before. Mostly about Flexbox and the structuring of the website. I feel like it's coming together. Still a lot to practice on though. 

4. Because this is a big project, I tried to make my code structured and easy to work with as possible. Adding Comments to each section I was working on, e.g headers, footers, contents(box-1,box-2,box-3,..). It worked well!

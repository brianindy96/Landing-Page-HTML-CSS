# My First Landing Page
This Project I am going to make a Landing Page of a Coffee Shop. It's finally time to put some designs into our bland HTML site. The Format of the Design for the website is already given by TOP, but the rest is up to the Developer. 

What I've learnt before the Project:

- Concepts of Flex and Alignment
- Basic CSS Functions.
- Padding, Margin, and Border
